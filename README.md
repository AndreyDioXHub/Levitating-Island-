To view the effect, point the external camera to a flat surface. Use gestures to place and scale the model on the selected plane.<br/><br/>
This work is based on the standard "World space object" provided by Spark AR, as educational material.<br/>
In this effect, modified "path editor". For animations used "loopanimation" with a modification of the state of "transition".
Model developed using 3Ds max and photoshop.
